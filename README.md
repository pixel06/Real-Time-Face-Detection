# Real-Time-Face-Detection
This repository contains the source code for a face recognition project using OpenCV. The project aims to detect and recognize faces in real-time using computer vision techniques.

# Features
Real-Time Face Detection: Utilizes a Haar cascade classifier to detect faces in live video streams.
Face Recognition: Implements face recognition algorithms to identify known faces.
User Interface: Displays live video feed with overlaid bounding boxes around detected faces.
Performance Optimization: Optimizes parameters for faster and more accurate detection and recognition.

# Technologies Used
Python Libraries: OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
Data Handling: JSON for storing known face encodings

# How to Use
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FaceRecognition.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the face recognition script:

bash
Copy code
python face_recognition.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the face recognition system.

# Demo
A live demo of the face recognition project can be found here.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or fork the repository and submit a pull request.

# Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the contributors of OpenCV and the Python community for their invaluable libraries and resources.
